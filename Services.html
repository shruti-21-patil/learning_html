       <p>Be it vivacious floral arrangements for gifting or bringing a dream event come to life, Interflora works in close quarters with customers to create a bespoke experience for any occasion with an awe-inspiring touch. Even while planning for an event, Interflora goes out of its way to provide solutions that ensure every experience exceeds expectations and leaves an everlasting memory.

Interflora takes pride in reshaping the floral landscape of the country. The reason why we have earned the trust of some of the most esteemed clientele in India for all floral solutions. The brand has covered some of the most celebrated weddings and events for Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal, Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor, Kiara Advani and Sidharth Malhotra, Karan Johar, the Jindals, Gucci, Dior, Sonam Babbani, House Of Misu, Anamika Khanna, Ali Fazal & Richa Chadha and many more.

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Interflora takes sustainability into account too. The life of every floral waste is extended by creating various flower-infused products like candles, teas and more. Making sure, the fresh cuts are a gift that keeps on giving.

Alongside, to ensure the brand’s love reflects in its working too, Interflora works with an ethical waste management system. And continues to source from homegrown farms and manufacturers to support local talent and welfare.

And lastly, the brand takes pride in its innovation prowess too. Be it creating a cold chain travel for preserving the blooms, using electric vehicles as an eco-friendly approach or mindfully crafting experiences instead of just products, Interflora pushes itself to be on top of the game. And to set industry standards, only to push them further.</p>
