    <h1><u>Flower</u></h1>

    <p><b>Flowers</b>, also known as <b>blooms</b> and <b>blossoms</b>, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants <i>(angiosperms)</i>. Typically, they are structured in four circular levels, called whorls, around the end of a stalk. These whorls include: calyx, modified leaves; corolla, the petals; androecium, the male reproductive unit consisting of stamens and pollen; and gynoecium, the female part, containing style and stigma, which receives the pollen at the tip of the style, and ovary, which contains the ovules. When flowers are arranged in groups, they are known collectively as inflorescences.</p>

    <p>Floral growth originates at stem tips and is controlled by <b>MADS-box</b> genes. In most plant species flowers are heterosporous, and so can produce sex cells of both sexes. Pollination mediates the transport of pollen to the ovules in the ovaries, to facilitate sexual reproduction. It can occur between different plants, as in cross-pollination, or between flowers on the same plant or even the same flower, as in self-pollination. Vectors transport the pollen between stamen and stigma. They may be living animals, such as birds and insects, or non-living factors such as wind and water. The colour and structure of flowers—such as nectaries and nectar guides—assist in pollination.</p>
    
    <p>After pollination, both sex cells <i>(excluding their cell walls)</i> and their nuclei are fused together in the process of fertilisation. The result is a cell called a <b>zygote</b>, which has two copies of each chromosome. Through cellular and nuclear division, the zygote grows into a seed, which contains structures to assist in the future plant's survival and growth. At the same time, the ovary forms into a fruit, and the other floral structures die. The function of fruit is to protect the seed and aid in dispersal. This dispersal is divided into vectors originating either from external sources, or from the plant itself. External vectors include both living things, such as animals and insects, and non-living things, such as wind and water.</p>
